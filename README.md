Hello, thank you for visiting my website!

​

I am a student doctor at Barts & The London Medical School; I have completed 4 years of MBBS and have an MSc in Regenerative Medicine.

​

I am also the former CEO of JC Tuition (2019-2022), a tutoring agency that has helped dozens of students achieve outstanding results around the country.

​

Prior to medical school, I have always been passionate about education. At GCSEs I achieved 2 A*s, 7As, 1B and during my A-Levels I achieved 3A*s (Biology, Chemistry, Maths).

​

My current passion is teaching and helping students around the UK achieve excellence in mathematics and science! I have 4+ years of tutoring experience in all age groups and have received extremely positive feedback.
